# Last Working Day Emailer #

As a developer, I thought lets just send last working day email at TCS as an automated email.
So I wrote this simplest command line program with NodeJS.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Sending Email

### How do I get set up? ###

* git clone https://github.com/saurabhnemade/lastworkingday.git
* npm install
*  node index.js -m template.tpl  -f 'your_work_email' -t to.lst -r 'your_work_email,your_personal_email' -s 'subject_of_email' -e company_smtp_server
